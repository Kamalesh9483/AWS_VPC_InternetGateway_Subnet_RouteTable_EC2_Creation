# AWS_VPC_InternetGateway_Subnet_RouteTable_EC2_Creation

This project involves manually setting up an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with essential networking components and launching an EC2 instance. The setup includes:  

- **VPC Creation**: Defines a custom VPC with a specific CIDR range.  
- **Internet Gateway Setup**: Enables internet access for public-facing resources.  
- **Subnet Configuration**:  
  - Public and private subnets within the VPCâ€™s IP CIDR range.  
  - Public subnet allows external access, while the private subnet is isolated.  
- **Route Table Setup**:  
  - Public route table attached to the internet gateway for internet access.  
  - Private route table for internal communication.  
- **EC2 Instance Deployment**: Creates an EC2 instance within the public subnet.  
- **SSH Verification**: Connect to the EC2 instance to confirm that it is running successfully.
